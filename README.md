# 💻 Computer Architecture Lab – VHDL Projects

This repository contains a collection of digital design projects implemented as part of the **Computer Architecture Laboratory** course in an undergraduate Electrical Engineering program. The projects are written in **VHDL** and simulate fundamental components of digital systems using **Xilinx ISE**.

## 🧩 Project List

- `ALU`: Design and implementation of an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) supporting operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, etc.
- `Bus_Interface`: Design of a simple data bus interface with control and data signals to connect multiple modules.
- `RAM_1KB`: Synchronous 1KB Random Access Memory module implemented and simulated at RTL level.
- `UpDown_Counter`: An 8-bit up/down counter with enable and reset inputs, suitable for timing and control applications.
- `Parity_Detector`: A simple parity detector circuit that checks the parity of an input bitstream.
- `Serial_Interfaces`: Ongoing work on implementing SPI, I2C, and RS232 communication protocols in VHDL (in progress).

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language)
- **Simulation & Synthesis Tool:** Xilinx ISE
- **Target Devices:** Spartan-3 / Nexys FPGA development boards (or similar)

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Open the desired project folder in **Xilinx ISE**.
2. Use the provided **testbench files** to run behavioral simulations.
3. Synthesize and implement the design if you want to test it on hardware.
4. Analyze the waveform results and validate module behavior.

## 📌 Notes

- Each project is written in a modular, testable format.
- Designed primarily for educational purposes and hands-on experience with digital logic.
- Some components (especially communication interfaces) are still under development.
